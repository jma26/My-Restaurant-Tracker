# RestaurantFive0
This repo contains the source code for my restaurant review website.

## What I've learned
Implementation of 3rd-party Google Maps, Saving uploaded photos into MongoDB and retrieving them, reactive form controls and validation

## Goal 
One feature I want to implement into Yelp is an overview of all restaurant reviews marked in google maps as markers. These Clusters of markers in certain areas may indicate the popularity of the restaurant community and help visualize the data abstractly. For now, I've created my own barebone, personal restaurant reviews. 

## Technologies
Built using Angular 5, MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, [Angular Google Maps](https://github.com/SebastianM/angular-google-maps), and [Facebook Login SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login)
